The version with just one plus sign might be a little bit confusing at first.

Let us compare it with the two-plus-version. The two-plus version in the following picture starts with the point (5.5,5.5), from there we move one unit to the right and one unit up and from _this new point_ one unit to the left and one unit up.

The one-plus-version uses the point (8.5,5.5) as _reference base_ for *all* following one-plus-coordinates. We start from (8.5,5.5) one unit to the right and one unit up, the next coordinate is one unit to the left and one unit up from the original point (8.5,5.5).
