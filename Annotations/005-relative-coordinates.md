You can also use relative coordinates by adding one or two plus signs before the coordinate.

The version with two plus signs updates the coordinate from which the relative steps are taken, so based on some point we say "move x units horizontally and y units vertically", the next relative coordinate uses the newly created coordinate to determine the next step.
